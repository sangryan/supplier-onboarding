## Adding the Handshake Image

To complete the setup, please add the handshake illustration image:

1. Save your handshake image as `handshake.png` in this directory
2. The image should be in PNG format for best quality with transparency
3. Recommended size: At least 500x500 pixels for crisp display on all devices

## Image Usage

The handshake image is used in:
- Landing page hero section
- Login page
- Register page  
- 2FA page (via AuthLayout component)

The image will automatically scale responsively across all screen sizes.

## File Path
The components reference the image as: `/images/handshake.png`

This maps to: `client/public/images/handshake.png` in the file system.
